about dbatools

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes a bit about the module, and some important links to get help and more details.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

dbatools started as just a migration script for SharePoint databases and has turned into a module now with over 650 functions and cmdlets.

Each command has its own documentation via Comment based help that can be accessed using Get-Help locally on your device, or you can find web views at https://docs.dbatools.io. The remainder of this help file contains details on advanced features and configuration the module offers.

## Reporting Bugs/Features

🐛 happen, we would 💘 if you report those and any features you may see missing via GitHub:
https://github.com/dataplat/dbatools/issues/new/choose

With bug reports please try to provide scripts/code that can replicate the issue as the more easily we can replicate it in our labs the faster we will get a release out with the fix(es).

Many of the commands in the module have Verbose output, and some have debugging output as well. Including all of data in your bug report would be greatly appreciated.

## Environment Variables

Certain features in the module are activated upon import and the primary use is for interaction with the user in a live session of PowerShell. With automation being non-interactive you can shave off potentially minutes by "disabling" these with your script executions.

Set these environment variables either at the top of your script, or as System Variables for your given Operating System for more global use.

### DBATOOLS_DISABLE_TEPP

Example: `$env:DBATOOLS_DISABLE_TEPP = $false`

TEPP is a tab expansion functionality that is purely interactive in purpose. When you reference say -Name parameter on Get-DbaDatabase, we populate that parameter behind the scenes with all the available database names of the instance referenced in -SqlInstance parameter.

Set this value to false and it will disable this background process.

### DBATOOLS_DISABLE_LOGGING

Example: `$env:DBATOOLS_DISABLE_LOGGING = $false`

Our logging system is a pre-based version of the PSFramework module and graciously added/maintained by Fred. There is a runspace created that captures the logging output as each command is called and writes to a local file on the filesystem.

This can be a drag on performance and if you do not need that logged information set this environment variable to disable it.
